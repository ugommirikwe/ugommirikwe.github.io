# Introduction

In the world of programming, the ability to create copies of objects is often a crucial requirement. While Swift provides a powerful standard library, it lacks a built-in functionality similar to Kotlin's data class copy function. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement a custom copy functionality in Swift, inspired by Kotlin's approach. This functionality allows us to create copies of objects with ease, making our code more concise and efficient.

Code Explanation:
Let's dive into the code that defines a protocol called "Copyable" and its associated functions. The protocol has a single function called "copy" which takes in two parameters: a keyPath and a value. The keyPath parameter represents a path to a specific property in an object, while the value parameter is the new value that will be assigned to the property specified by the keyPath.

The extension of the Copyable protocol provides an implementation for the "copy" function. Inside the implementation, it first checks if the keyPath can be casted to a WritableKeyPath, which is a subclass of KeyPath that allows for writing to the property. If it cannot be casted, it simply returns the original object without making any changes.

If the keyPath can be casted to a WritableKeyPath, it creates a mutable copy of the object using the "var" keyword. Then, it assigns the new value to the property specified by the keyPath using the subscript syntax. Finally, it returns the modified copy of the object.

Functionality Similar to Kotlin's data class copy:
The custom copy functionality we have implemented in Swift bears resemblance to Kotlin's data class copy function. Kotlin's data class automatically generates a copy function that creates a new instance of the class with the specified properties overridden. Similarly, our custom copy functionality allows us to create copies of objects and modify specific properties effortlessly.

Example Usages in Redux State Reducer:
Let's consider a scenario where we have a Redux state reducer in Swift. We can utilize the custom copy functionality to handle state updates efficiently. Here are a few example usages:

Updating a Single Property:
Suppose we have a state object representing a user profile with properties like name, email, and age. To update just the name property, we can use the custom copy functionality as follows:
let updatedState = currentState.copy(\.name, "John Doe")
This creates a copy of the current state object with the name property overridden to "John Doe". The rest of the properties remain unchanged.

Modifying Multiple Properties:
In some cases, we may need to modify multiple properties of the state object simultaneously. With the custom copy functionality, we can achieve this easily:
let updatedState = currentState
    .copy(\.name, "John Doe")
    .copy(\.age, 30)
    .copy(\.email, "john.doe@example.com")
Here, we chain multiple copy operations to create a new state object with the desired property modifications.

Benefits and Use Cases:
By implementing this custom copy functionality, we can enhance our Swift codebase in several ways:

Concise Code: The custom copy functionality reduces the boilerplate code required to create copies of objects and modify specific properties. It promotes cleaner and more readable code.

Immutable Objects: Swift encourages immutability, and the custom copy functionality aligns with this principle. Instead of modifying existing objects directly, we create new copies with the desired changes, ensuring data integrity and avoiding unexpected side effects.

Functional Programming: The custom copy functionality supports functional programming paradigms by allowing us to create new objects based on existing ones, without mutating the original objects.

Conclusion:
In this blog post, we explored how to implement a custom copy functionality in Swift, inspired by Kotlin's data class copy function. We discussed the code explanation, highlighting the key components and their functionalities. We also showcased example usages in a Redux state reducer scenario, demonstrating how the custom copy functionality can simplify state updates. By incorporating this functionality into our Swift projects, we can enhance code readability, maintainability, and overall development experience.

(Note: The custom copy functionality described in this blog post is not part of the Swift standard library but rather an idea proposed by the user.)
