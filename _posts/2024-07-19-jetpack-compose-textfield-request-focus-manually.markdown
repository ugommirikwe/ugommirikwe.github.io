The [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/focus/change-focus-behavior#request-keyboard){:target="_blank"} states that to manually request focus on a textfield as a response to user interaction, you use this code:

```kotlin
val focusRequester = remember { FocusRequester() }
var text by remember { mutableStateOf("") }

TextField(
    value = text,
    onValueChange = { text = it },
    modifier = Modifier.focusRequester(focusRequester)
)

Button(onClick = { focusRequester.requestFocus() }) {
    Text("Request focus on TextField")
}
```

Well, I ran into an issue where the text field wasn't receiving focus using the above code, and, therefore, the soft keyboard wasn't showing up. Hours of [stackoverflowing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64181930/request-focus-on-textfield-in-jetpack-compose){:target="_blank"} and [googling](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/204502668){:target="_blank"} the issue only dug up solutions for other people who wanted to auto-focus on a text field on initial screen load. That's a different use case from my requirement.

My use case was quite similar to what the official documentation above indicated, but with a slight twist: I set up the screen's root `Column` composable with a `clickable` modifier, which uses the FocusManager object to clear focus from the input field, thus dismissing the soft keyboard, when tapped:

```kotlin
...
val focusManager = LocalFocusManager.current
...
Column(
    modifier = Modifier
        .clickable {
            focusManager.clearFocus()
        }
) {...}
```

Reading further in the official documentation page I did a double-take on the [Capture and release focus section](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/focus/change-focus-behavior#capture-release-focus) and got the idea to first call `focusRequester.freeFocus()` before calling `focusRequester.requestFocus()`.

Here's what I ended up doing:

```kotlin
Button(onClick = { 
    focusRequester.freeFocus() 
    focusRequester.requestFocus() 
}) {
    Text("Request focus on TextField")
}
```

Et voila! It worked: the text field was now getting focus and the soft keyboard now showing up when the button is clicked.
